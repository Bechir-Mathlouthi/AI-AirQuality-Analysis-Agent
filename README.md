# AI AQI Analysis Agent

## Overview

	This is a simple AI agent that uses a neural network to predict the AQI (Air Quality Index) based on historical data.
	The agent is trained using the Keras library and the TensorFlow backend.
## Requirements		- Python 3.6 or later		- Keras		- TensorFlow		- Pandas		- Numpy		- Matplotlib		- Scikit-learn		- Jupyter Notebook

## Usage					To use this agent, you will need to have a dataset of historical AQI data. The dataset should be in CSV format and should contain the following columns:		- Date		- AQI		- PM2.5		- PM10		- NO2		- SO2		- CO		- O3		- Temperature		- Humidity		- Wind Speed		- Wind Direction

	## Installation

		To install the required libraries, you can use the following command:

			pip install -r requirements.txt

	## Training

		To train the agent, you can use the following command:

			python train.py --dataset <path_to_dataset>

	## Prediction

		To predict the AQI, you can use the following command:

			python predict.py --model <path_to_model> --data <path_to_data>

	## Results
